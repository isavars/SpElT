# Spelt - the Spatial Electrophysiology Toolbox
### Spelt is a python-based toolkit for analysis of co-recorded electrophysiological and behavioural data, based on [scaNpix](https://github.com/LaurenzMuessig/scaNpix), and using [SpikeInterface](https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spikeinterface) v0.101+
### Currently this is implemented for loading, processing and analysing raw data from Axona systems, with Neuropixels 2 Open Ephys recordings as a WIP
•	The package code requires Python 3.9, owing to several dependencies

•	Development by [Jake Swann](https://github.com/jakeswann1/) @ Wills-Cacucci Lab, UCL

# Usage
### This repo is currently designed to be used with the following workflow:
To extract and analyse CA1 pyramidal cell spike data:
1. Record raw Axona or OpenEphys files
2. Run _Spike Sorting From Sheet.ipynb_ (requires correctly formatted Google Sheet and data directory, or you can load your own .xlsx). This collates individual trials into sessions, runs Kilosort 2/4 (depending on probe type) and extracts position data
4. Manually curate spikes in phy
5. Use the _spelt.ephys_ object and methods to load your data into the ephys object
6. Use the analysis and mapping functions to solve the brain
