def calculate_choices(xy_positions, sector_numbers):
    """
    Function to calculate choice statistics based on sector numbers for each XY position.

    Parameters:
    xy_positions (numpy.ndarray): An array containing the XY positions. This input is not used in the current function version.
    sector_numbers (numpy.ndarray): An array containing sector numbers for each XY position.
                                    Sector numbers should be between 1 and 12 inclusive.

    Returns:
    dict: A dictionary containing the following keys:
        - total_choices: The total number of valid choices made.
        - total_left_choices: The total number of times a choice was made to go left.
        - total_right_choices: The total number of times a choice was made to go right.
        - total_correct_choices: The total number of correct choices made. A correct choice is defined as a choice
                                 to go in the opposite direction of the previous choice.
        - p_correct: The proportion of correct choices made (total_correct_choices / total_choices).
        - p_left_choices: The proportion of left choices made (total_left_choices / total_choices).

    Raises:
    ValueError: If the sector numbers are not between 1 and 12 inclusive.

    Notes:
    The function assumes that the animal starts in the center sector (sector numbers 5, 6, 7, 8).
    If the animal starts in the left sectors (sector numbers 1, 2, 3, 4) or the right sectors (sector numbers 9, 10, 11, 12),
    a message will be printed to the console. If the sector numbers are not within these ranges, an error message will be printed.

    The function uses a state variable `choice` to keep track of the current choice (left, right, or center),
    and this is updated based on the current sector number. The choice is then encoded as a numeric value (left: 1, right: 2, center: 0)
    and stored in the `arm_ind` array.

    After encoding the choices, the function removes consecutive duplicates to get the sequence of arm visits `arm_visit_order`.
    It then iterates over this sequence to count the number of choices made and the number of correct choices.
    A correct choice is defined as a choice to go in the opposite direction of the previous choice.

    Finally, it calculates the proportion of correct choices and the proportion of left choices and returns these values in a dictionary.
